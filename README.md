# Azure-landing-zone-accelerator
Deploy Azure landing zone using ARM based accelerator

## Platform landing zone accelerator

The folder Platform landing zone accelerator contains the instructions and JSON files (in case they are not available on Azure). To address the challenge of removing Azure Landing Zone infrastructure, we have developed a deletion script located in the [Delete](https://github.com/intikhabalam/Azure-landing-zone-accelerator/blob/main/Platform%20landing%20zone%20accelerator/delete%20script/delete%20alz.ps1) folder of our GitHub repository. You can access the script and its documentation here. This script automates the removal of all deployed infrastructure and policies created by the Azure Landing Zone platform within your subscription.
